        "date": "June 20, 2022",
        "summary": "A new report reveals that half of all Americans suffer from musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, a leading cause of disability and work absenteeism. The study highlights that MSK conditions, such as back pain, affect people across all age groups, and the growing prevalence of these disorders is linked to factors like sedentary lifestyles and aging. The report emphasizes the need for preventive measures and better access to treatment to manage MSK pain and improve quality of life for those affected.",

        "summary": "OSHA has intensified efforts to address heat-related workplace injuries through a National Emphasis Program (NEP) launched in 2022. The NEP targets industries with significant heat exposure, focusing on workplaces with a heat index of 80°F or higher. OSHA will conduct inspections triggered by heat warnings and reported heat hazards, ensuring employers provide cool water, rest breaks, training, and other heat illness prevention measures. The program aims to increase enforcement and inspections to better protect workers from heat-related risks.",

        "summary": "Amazon has joined over 15 companies in the MSD Pledge, committing to reduce musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) by 25% by 2025. MSDs, caused by repetitive movements or poor ergonomics, are common injuries like back and wrist pain. The pledge is part of Amazon's $12 million partnership with the National Safety Council. Despite facing criticism for high injury rates, Amazon aims to reduce MSD injuries by 40% and focuses on continuous improvement, employee feedback, and safety investments to enhance workplace conditions.",

        "summary": "This scoping review examines the methods used to measure physical workload among commercial cleaners, a labor-intensive profession with high musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) risks. The review identifies 48 studies, primarily employing direct measurements, and highlights the use of multiple methods to assess physical workload factors like task duration, posture, and force exertion. It discusses various measurement tools, including observational assessments and self-reports, while also addressing their strengths and limitations for researchers and safety practitioners. The findings emphasize the need for combined approaches to assess external and internal exposures, as well as the acute physical responses associated with cleaning tasks.",
