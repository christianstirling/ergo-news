The study, part of the Poultry Processing Line Speed Evaluation Study (PULSE), found that injuries often go unreported and can be mitigated by increasing staffing and implementing effective ergonomic plans. Key findings indicated that workers at higher piece rates and evisceration line speeds experienced similar musculoskeletal disorder risks, and 40% reported moderate to severe work-related pain. Additionally, airborne peracetic acid levels exceeded safety limits in one in five jobs sampled across establishments.

        "summary": "Back injuries are a leading cause of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, accounting for 40% of cases requiring time off work. Repetitive heavy lifting or improper lifting posture are major contributors to these injuries. In response, NIOSH introduced the NIOSH Lifting Equation (NLE) Calc app in 2017 to help assess lifting risks and prevent injuries by calculating the Recommended Weight Limit (RWL) and Lifting Index (LI). The app was updated in September 2024, with new features designed to improve usability and efficiency, incorporating feedback from users to enhance its effectiveness in reducing workplace lifting risks.",
